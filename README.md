# From Virtual Pitch to Data: Unraveling FIFA Player Insights

## Background

The FIFA virtual football game dates back to the early 1990s and has evolved significantly since then, becoming the most popular and enduring sports simulation game worldwide. Its extensive history has cultivated a massive following that includes players and fans from diverse backgrounds. Today, online gaming platforms attract millions of players and viewers for FIFA simulation games and tournaments, creating a new genre of digital sports that engages football enthusiasts as both spectators and gamers.

Currently, several online tournaments involve significant prize money. In the FIFA universe, player quality serves as the foundation of gameplay, directly influencing tournament outcomes. Player attributes are the driving force shaping the gaming experience. These attributes determine players' behavior and the uniqueness of the game. The vast number of players with unique attributes opens up numerous possibilities for creating an optimal user experience for both gamers and spectators.

## Problem Statement

This rich background leads to critical challenges, such as whether the gameplay is balanced. A balanced gameplay ensures that a highly skilled player has a fair match against an averagely skilled one. Additionally, FIFA offers a career mode where players can act as a manager or an upcoming player. However, this mode still has room for added realism and depth.

Through this project and the FIFA21 player dataset, we aim to address the following questions:

1. **What are the most significant attributes associated with a player, how do they impact overall ratings, and can we build a predictive model for this?**
2. **What attributes affect a playerâ€™s market value, and what trends can we identify in it?**
3. **What hidden trends in the dataset can help improve gameplay balance, leading to an enhanced playing experience?**

By addressing these challenges, we seek to align the virtual gaming experience with real-world football standards, thereby making the gameplay more immersive. This would lead to improved gameplay balance, better team tactics and formation strategies, and a deeper understanding of player dynamics, all of which will help gamers make informed decisions. The results could actively contribute to the gaming community and its audience.
